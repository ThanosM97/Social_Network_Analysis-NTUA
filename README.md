## Lab 1 - Study and Analysis of Complex Topological Networks
The goal of this lab was to create complex topologies using the networkx library and study them using multiple metrics. One of the metrics we use is the ego-betweenness centrality for which we implement a function to calculate it for each node of a graph using the algorithm described in the paper [Ego network betweenness](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S037887330400067X) by Martin Everett and Stephen P.Borgatti.
